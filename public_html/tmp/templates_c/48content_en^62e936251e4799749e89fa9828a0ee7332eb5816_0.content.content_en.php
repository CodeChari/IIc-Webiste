<h2>Linux Lab<img src="http://iic.ac.in/uploads/images/LINUXlab.jpg" alt="" width="555" height="320" /></h2>
<p>In the very first year of the degree, students are made to work on Linux environment. The lab is&nbsp;equipped with the latest high-end workstations (Linux OS). With systems with AMD Quad-Core processors(HT), interconnected in a 100 Mbps network. Dedicated Internet&nbsp;connectivity is provided through National Knowledge Network(NKN).&nbsp;The lab is made inside a Bamboo Hut, dedicated especially to First-Year Students of IIC. It is&nbsp;maintained by the students themselves and is interconnected to Communication\&nbsp;Microprocessors Lab thus allowing easy access and perfect exchange of resources.</p>

<h2>Macintosh Lab</h2>
<p><img title="Mac Lab" src="http://iic.du.ac.in/uploads/images/Gallery/Infrastructure%20IIC/MAC%20Lab/macLab1.jpg" alt="Macintosh Lab" width="843" height="426" /></p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<p><code></code>Keeping up its pioneering spirit, the full-fledged Macintosh Lab with latest live servers makes&nbsp;a long story short by making IIC among the best institutes in terms of technology and&nbsp;resources. The Macintosh Lab is designed in such a way that it doubles up as a discussion&nbsp;room for the students where they hold numerous live projects. Equipped with projectors and&nbsp;LED&rsquo;s for better presentation, it makes a perfect room for teaching and research. The&nbsp;placement of Networking Lab right above IIC&rsquo;s Mac lab leaves no room for students to test&nbsp;their abilities and take wide projects with multiple technology requirements and work on real-time projects as well.</p><?php }
