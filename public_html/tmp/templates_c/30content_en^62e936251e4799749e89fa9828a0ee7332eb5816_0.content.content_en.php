<h2><strong>Master of Science (Informatics) - Two-year degree programme</strong></h2>
<h4><br />The two-year post-graduate degree programme provides students theoretical knowledge and practical&nbsp;skills relating to computers, programming languages, graphics and multimedia applications,&nbsp;telecommunication systems, networking, and management of information systems. The students,&nbsp;after completing the two-year programme, are expected to attain a good background in conventional&nbsp;computer programming, and expertise in computers and telecommunication networks. To supplement&nbsp;the academic inputs, it is mandatory for all the students to undergo practical training (summer training/ project) in house or in a business/ industrial/ research organisation, at the end of II or IV semester of&nbsp;the programme. Students who successfully complete a total of 138 credits, from all the four semesters&nbsp;and summer training, are awarded the degree of M.Sc. in Informatics.</h4>
<h4>Since the students come from different disciplines, to bring them at par before starting the regular&nbsp;courses, a zero semester of about one-month has been introduced. During the Zero semester,&nbsp;students take courses in topics in which they do not have an adequate background and are exposed&nbsp;to laboratory and Internet. Out of various papers specified for the zero semester a minimum of two&nbsp;papers have to be taken by every student and depending on the background, a student may be&nbsp;advised to take more than two papers. Zero semester papers do not carry any credit for the purpose&nbsp;of classification of results. This period is also used for training students needing financial assistance&nbsp;to work as teaching or administrative assistants.</h4>
